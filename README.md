# MCS-HCD-Prototype
Source and unit test code for a simple MCS HCD prototype. The code exercises a lifecycle command, an operational command and can send and receive events.

The code doesnâ€™t represent a HCD in the true sense. There are now CSW aspects to it and it functions more as a standalone application that implements 0MQ and Goggle Protocol Buffers
